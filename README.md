Welcome to Lendwise, a Smart Lender System built with the power of machine learning! This project aims to predict loan eligibility based on various factors using different classification models. The frontend of the application is developed using React and leverages frameworks like Formik and Yup for form handling. On the backend, we have a Flask server that interacts with a Python model, which performs data processing, scaling, and training using classification techniques such as KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XG Boost, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.
